# CHANGELOG

## M1 — Receiving + labels + Telegram — 2026-07-22

- Client code auto-generation: empty code on create ⇒ next sequential code for the configured prefix (advisory-lock protected); manual duplicates still rejected (owner's request).
- Schema: receipts, receipt_lots, boxes, box_movements, product_dictionary, cost_types, cost_entries, counters; trigram indexes for search.
- Letter sequencer (spec 5.3): pure A…ZZ logic with blacklist skip, ZZ→A wrap + cycle_no, optional I/O exclusion — 10 unit tests; transactional assignment under warehouse row lock with a concurrency integration test (acceptance tests 1–4).
- Code generators: receipt numbers ({WH}-IN-{YYMMDD}-{seq}, per-WH-local-day) and box short codes ({WH}{YY}-{000000}, per-WH-year) via lock-safe counters.
- W1 receiving wizard (mobile stepper Client→Lots→Costs→Review→Confirm→Print): fuzzy client autocomplete, unknown-code → unclaimed intake, uniform/mixed lots with live volume/density badge/chargeable weight (acceptance test 5), min-1-photo with client-side compression, letter preview, extra costs with CNY default at CN warehouses, localStorage draft autosave surviving app kill.
- Confirm transaction: letters + boxes + movements + ReceiptConfirmed/UnknownCargoReceived event in one transaction, idempotent by client-generated receipt UUID.
- Label PDF (spec §7): 100×100 mm, dominant client-code+letter, QR = short code, WH-local date, #UNKNOWN variant, embedded subset CJK font (Noto Sans SC); per-receipt/lot/box reprint with audit.
- zh→ru translation pipeline: dictionary exact → trigram fuzzy → pluggable API (LibreTranslate default), cached back into the dictionary; never blocks receiving.
- Notifications: event fan-out to in-app rows + Telegram via pg-boss with retry; grammY bot with /start deep-link account linking from the profile; ReceiptConfirmed → sales manager, UnknownCargoReceived → logist+admins.
- Screens: receipt list/detail (void with reason, per-lot reprint, History tab, photos), stock browser WH→client→lot→box with full box timeline, unclaimed pool, global search incl. the combined gs777-a form.
- Seed: canonical GS777 receipt (化妆品→A 250 kg/1.25 m³, 键盘→B, 鼠标 mixed→C), GS102 → D, cost types, dictionary entries — idempotent.
- Tests: 34 unit/integration + 4 Playwright mobile e2e (incl. the full receiving flow with photo upload and PDF check).

## M0 — Platform foundation — 2026-07-22

- Next.js 15 + strict TypeScript scaffold; pnpm workspace; Tailwind; docker-compose (app/postgres/minio/backup) for deploys.
- Drizzle schema + migrations: users, sessions, login_attempts, RBAC tables, warehouses (with letter-sequencer state), clients, settings, currencies, fx_rates, letter_blacklist, audit_log (append-only, DB-level immutability trigger + revoked grants), events, notifications, telegram_links, attachments; pg_trgm + trigram indexes.
- Auth: phone/username + Argon2id, httpOnly 30-day rolling sessions in Postgres, 5/15min rate limiting, device list + "logout other devices".
- Data-driven RBAC seeded from the §16 matrix; single `authorize()` server-side gate with warehouse scoping.
- Audit write path (changed-fields before/after diff) on every mutation; reusable History tab; admin global audit browser with filters; domain-event emitter + events table.
- Admin CRUDs: warehouses, clients (code validated against `client_code_prefix`), users (roles + warehouse binding); settings editor for all §17 keys.
- i18n: next-intl with ru/uz/zh-CN catalogs, per-user locale, header switcher.
- Files: storage abstraction (S3/MinIO + signed local-disk dev driver), upload API, sharp 200/800px thumbnails via pg-boss, photo gallery component.
- PWA: manifest + icons + Serwist app-shell caching; role-aware Home with big-button shortcuts; high-contrast UI, no horizontal scroll at 360px.
- Observability: pino logs, `/health`, pg-boss started via instrumentation hook.
- Seed: 7 warehouses, 11 users (one per role, `demo1234`), 20 clients (GS777→Dilnoza), currencies, blacklist AM/XU, settings, permission matrix.
- Tests: 15 unit (audit diff, RBAC matrix, client-code format) + 3 Playwright mobile e2e (login guard, admin CRUD + audit flow, warehouse-scope isolation); GitHub Actions CI (typecheck, lint, unit, migrate+seed, build, e2e).

## Planning stage — 2026-07-22

- Added `docs/SPEC.md` — the Phase 1 WMS build specification (single source of truth).
- Added `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — application architecture + complete PostgreSQL/Drizzle schema design for all milestones.
- Added `docs/PLAN.md` — M0–M6 task breakdown, acceptance-test mapping, edge-case → milestone table, testing strategy, and open questions for the owner.
- Added `DECISIONS.md` — 24 pre-implementation ambiguity resolutions.
- No application code yet — implementation starts with M0 after owner approval.
