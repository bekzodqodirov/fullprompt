# CHANGELOG

## M0 — Platform foundation — 2026-07-22

- Next.js 15 + strict TypeScript scaffold; pnpm workspace; Tailwind; docker-compose (app/postgres/minio/backup) for deploys.
- Drizzle schema + migrations: users, sessions, login_attempts, RBAC tables, warehouses (with letter-sequencer state), clients, settings, currencies, fx_rates, letter_blacklist, audit_log (append-only, DB-level immutability trigger + revoked grants), events, notifications, telegram_links, attachments; pg_trgm + trigram indexes.
- Auth: phone/username + Argon2id, httpOnly 30-day rolling sessions in Postgres, 5/15min rate limiting, device list + "logout other devices".
- Data-driven RBAC seeded from the §16 matrix; single `authorize()` server-side gate with warehouse scoping.
- Audit write path (changed-fields before/after diff) on every mutation; reusable History tab; admin global audit browser with filters; domain-event emitter + events table.
- Admin CRUDs: warehouses, clients (code validated against `client_code_prefix`), users (roles + warehouse binding); settings editor for all §17 keys.
- i18n: next-intl with ru/uz/zh-CN catalogs, per-user locale, header switcher.
- Files: storage abstraction (S3/MinIO + signed local-disk dev driver), upload API, sharp 200/800px thumbnails via pg-boss, photo gallery component.
- PWA: manifest + icons + Serwist app-shell caching; role-aware Home with big-button shortcuts; high-contrast UI, no horizontal scroll at 360px.
- Observability: pino logs, `/health`, pg-boss started via instrumentation hook.
- Seed: 7 warehouses, 11 users (one per role, `demo1234`), 20 clients (GS777→Dilnoza), currencies, blacklist AM/XU, settings, permission matrix.
- Tests: 15 unit (audit diff, RBAC matrix, client-code format) + 3 Playwright mobile e2e (login guard, admin CRUD + audit flow, warehouse-scope isolation); GitHub Actions CI (typecheck, lint, unit, migrate+seed, build, e2e).

## Planning stage — 2026-07-22

- Added `docs/SPEC.md` — the Phase 1 WMS build specification (single source of truth).
- Added `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — application architecture + complete PostgreSQL/Drizzle schema design for all milestones.
- Added `docs/PLAN.md` — M0–M6 task breakdown, acceptance-test mapping, edge-case → milestone table, testing strategy, and open questions for the owner.
- Added `DECISIONS.md` — 24 pre-implementation ambiguity resolutions.
- No application code yet — implementation starts with M0 after owner approval.
