/**
 * The «Hisoblatish» collection, as the bot holds it.
 *
 * A collection is a few minutes of one person's attention: press the button,
 * forward the client's files and facts, press «Bo'ldi». It lives in memory
 * with a TTL, like the round-35 task-result pendings and the round-21
 * connect flow — the FILES are not in memory, they go straight to storage
 * pre-bound to the note id minted here, exactly as the receiving wizard
 * pre-binds lot photos before the receipt exists.
 *
 * What that costs, stated plainly: a bot restart mid-collection loses the
 * typed text and the person starts again. The alternative — a table, a
 * status column and a cleanup job for abandoned rows — is more machinery
 * than a five-minute conversation deserves, and the confirmed result is
 * persisted the moment it matters.
