/**
 * The facts a staff member typed, read without a model.
 *
 * Two reasons this exists rather than leaning on the AI for everything.
 * First, honesty: a person who wrote «5 kub» stated a fact, and a model that
 * missed it must not be able to erase it — so these values WIN over the
 * model's reading. Second, availability: the intake has to work on a server
 * with no API key at all, or the feature dies the day a key expires.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. It reads the shapes the office actually types — «250
 * kg», «5 kub», «Yiwu → Toshkent» — and leaves everything else to the model
 * and to the person's own eyes at the review step.
 */

/**
 * «250 kg», «250kg», «250 кг», «vazni 250 kg» → 250.
 *
 * The end of the unit is a NEGATIVE LOOKAHEAD, not `\b`: JavaScript's word
 * boundary is defined on ASCII, so «120кг» ends on a non-word character as
 * far as it is concerned and `\b` never matches — which is exactly how the
 * office writes it. (Caught by the test, not by reading the regex.)
 *
 * It reads EVERY occurrence, not the first, and answers only when the whole
 * collection agrees on ONE number. The owner's report — «7 8 ta malumot
 * tashlaganda … faqat 1 tasini tahlil qilyabti» — is partly this: eight
 * forwarded messages are joined into one string, the first «12 kg» in a
 * packing line won, and because a typed fact deliberately BEATS the model's
 * reading, that one line became the shipment's whole weight and the model's
 * total was thrown away. Several different numbers mean the office wrote
 * several numbers: that is a question for the reader (the model, which sees
 * all of the text) or for the VED, who can now type it on the screen.
